V1.6.5.3:
  * fixed streamers: veemi, yycast, streamhq, xuuby, zonein, limev, justintv, aliez, castamp
  * new streamers: ilive, castalba, 24cast, 04stream, tvcaston, liveflash, scity, ucaster (no working stream found so far), mybcast, xstit, yourlivetv, letontv, cast3d, zcast
  * fixed sites: chanfeed.com, firstrowsports.eu
  * changed site livetv.ru so new streamers are recognized
  * removed site soccerhd.info (site doesn't provide streams anymore)

<br>
V1.6.5:
  * much of the code rewritten and cleaned
  * added streamers: JustinTV
  * fixed some streamers: CastAmp, SeeOn, ...
  * improved detection of redirects
  * improved de-mystification of html source code
  * new context menu item 'Queue': adds both folders and videos to the current video playlist (folders are scanned for videos first). Please don't use the queue key on your remote (if configured) or 'q', if 'autoplay' is enabled. You can always use the context menu item.
  
  This new option allows you to:
    * make a simulcast of several matches
    * easily change to another stream if the current one is overloaded
    * create a playlist of tv channels and save it for later usage
  
  A known bug of this new feature is, that the current playlist is cleared by xbmc whenever an error occurs while trying to play a certain stream. I don't know why it doesn't just skip this item like it does with offline streams.
