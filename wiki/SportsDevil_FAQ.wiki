==_I often get 'No streams available' but there is definitely a stream on the website. What am I doing wrong?_==

'No streams available' means one of the following:

  * There is no stream
  * The streams are not supported
  * The streams are supported but not recognized


If a stream is not recognized, this can have one or several reasons:

  * The regular expression is wrong
  * The html source code is encrypted (escape sequences like %xx and custom javascript)
  * The website embeds the stream from another site by means of (i)frames


I have already written a 'demystification' function that is called if no stream is found on a first try. Most of the iframes are auto-selected and in addition to that I have implemented some of the javascript functions. The latter is hardcoded and very hard to keep up-to-date, so I would need a python function that parses javascript code. Any help appreciated.
